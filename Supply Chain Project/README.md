# Supply Chain Analysis Project

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where several important clients of AtliQ Mart chose not to renew their annual contracts because of service problems. Some of the key products may not have been supplied on schedule or in full over an extended period of time, which may have led to poor customer service. In order to quickly address this problem before expanding to additional locations, management asked their supply chain analytics team to track the "On time" and "In Full" delivery service levels for all clients on a daily basis.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to gauge the degree of service, in which they will compare the daily percentages of customer orders that are delivered on-time, in-full, and on-time in full (OTIF) against the goal service level set for each customer.

The task was to develop a dashboard for the Atliq Mart team that would provide information on customer service levels and insights into a supply chain problem in the FMCG industry.

Visualization Tool: Power BI
Database: Excel

1) Data cleaning and transformation in power query
2) Data modeling
3) Using DAX, creating measures
4) Dashboard design

I learned several things while working on this project:

1) Principles of dashboard design
2) DAX for developing metrics and visuals
3) Calculating day-over-day (DoD) and month-over-month (MoM) growth for KPIs using DAX
4) Using buttons and bookmarks to toggle visuals on and off
5) Visual conditional formatting
6) Knowledge of the supply chain domain
